Example

Here's a quick overview of how things work in the app:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize authentication system
        Authentication auth = new Authentication();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Register a new user
        System.out.println("Register a new user:");
        System.out.print("Username: ");
        String username = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.print("Password: ");
        String password = scanner.nextLine();
        if (auth.registerUser(username, password)) {
            System.out.println("Registration successful!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Username already exists.");
        }

        // Log in
        System.out.println("Login:");
        System.out.print("Username: ");
        String loginUsername = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.print("Password: ");
        String loginPassword = scanner.nextLine();
        User user = auth.login(loginUsername, loginPassword);
        if (user != null) {
            System.out.println("Welcome " + user.getUsername() + "!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid username or password.");
        }
        
        // Stock market interactions
        StockMarket market = new StockMarket();
        market.addUser(user);
        market.buyStock(user, "AAPL", 5);
        user.getPortfolio().showPortfolio();
    }
}
